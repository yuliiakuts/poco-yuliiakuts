Write a program, PowerCoders, which does the following:
★ Prints the numbers from 1-100 except:
★ For multiples of five, print “Power”
★ For multiples of seven, print “Coders”
★ For multiples of five and seven, print “PowerCoders”
Describe in words how you would write such a program. Make sure to write
out each step clearly. Imagine you have to explain to a non-coder what you
want to do and why. (This part of the exercise does not ask for any code.)
(Bonus if you have time: write a Javascript version of this program)


As you need to do 1 repeated operation 100 times, you should use loop.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.
The main idea of loop, that we check condition and do some operation 
while the condition is true.
In this example we shoud check a few conditions. And we can describe a programm 
as following steps.
1. Our start point is number 1.
2. We check if number <= 100 (cause we need to print all numbers in order including 100).
If number <=100 we do next step.
3. As we have additional condition we shoud also check them. 
4. First we check if number multiples of five and seven both. If it's true,
we print "PowerCoders". If false we check next condition.
5. Maybe number multiples of five. In case true, we print “Power”. In case false, 
we check next.
6. We check if number multiples of seven. If true, we print “Coders”. In false...
7. We print number.
8. Than add number+1 and go to the start of our loop for checking our first condition 
(number<=100).
9. If our number = 101, we end our programm.
